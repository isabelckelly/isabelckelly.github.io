        <h2> Where We Came From </h2>
        <p> Taco Tavern was founded in 2015 by Taco Man and Sir Burrito Barista
          the 3rd. These two met at Cal Poly, and bonded over their love for food and drink.
          Sir Barista had an extensive background in bartending and beer, while Taco Man
          had dedicated his life thus far to creating the perfect taco. Together, they decided
          to join forces and create the greatest taqueria/taproom the world had ever known. </p>

        <p> After the two graduated from Cal Poly with degrees in Advanced Restaurant Knowledge,
          they opened their doors to the first Taco Tavern location in downtown SLO. Since then, they
          have perfected the craft of beers and tacos. Should you find yourself in need
          of a good time, perfect food and Atmosphere, or to meet Mr. Man and Sir Barista for yourself,
          come on down to Taco Tavern. </p>
