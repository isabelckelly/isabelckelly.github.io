                                <p>You may not have heard of him, but Ricky Nelson is a diamond in the rough 50's-70's
                                artist who got his start on his parents' telivision show, <i> The Adventures of Ozzie
                                and Harriet</i>.</p>
                                <p>America loved him for his young good looks, and in 1957, He released his first hit, a cover of Fats Domino's "Im walkin'",
                              which jumpstarted his music career. As he kept on with music, he saw over 50 of his songs reach Billboard's top 100
                            1957 to 1973. His overwhelming success in the music business earned him a spot in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame. </p>

                                <p> Unfortunately, Nelson's career and life were cut way too short when he was killed in a plane crash on December 31, 1985.
                                  His private jet, a 1944 Douglas C-3 with a history of mechanical problems, went down in De Kalb, Texas, killing Nelson, Helen Blair
                                  and a few of his band members traveling with him.</p>

                                  <p>Pictured above are some of the remains of his plane, which reside in the The Williams House Museum in
                                  De Kalb, Texas. However, his legacy lives on with his star on the Hollywood walk of fame. He also was named number 91 of the top 100 artists of all time by
                                  Billboard Magazine. Next time you have a Garden Party, we hope that you'll think of Ricky Nelson and give him a listen. </p>
